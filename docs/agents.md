# Agents on other providers — design

Status: extra models for the Agent tool, built on the `agent-models` branch, 2026-10-30. Codex and Antigravity are verified live; Z.ai and OpenRouter need an inference key to verify. Research behind it: [docs/research/](research/) (A: Claude Code side,
B: Codex, C: Z.ai and OpenRouter, D: Antigravity, H: byte checks and live runs of the Agent-model design).

## What Claude sees

Nothing new to learn. The native list of agent types, which Claude Code puts in the conversation as
`Available agent types…`, gets two lines appended for the main session:

```
The Agent tool's model parameter also accepts these models the user added:
- sol: Reviews: code, plans and diffs that need strong coding reasoning. (Codex · gpt-6.1-sol · high)
```

Claude calls the built-in `Agent` tool as before and names the agent as the model:
`Agent({ subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: "sol" })`. The row, Show transcript, background,
`SendMessage`, `TaskStop`, `ListAgents` and Open in Terminal work as they do for agents on other Claude
accounts today. Tools and the system prompt are unchanged, so nothing new enters the prompt cache's
prefix: the requests are byte-identical in `tools` and `system` with and without the plugin (evidence:
[research H](research/H-agent-models.md)).

The rule: lastdrop changes where a subagent runs, never what runs. An added agent runs on its own provider
and model, and a Claude agent never runs on a different Claude model than the one asked for. If no account has
the model, the call fails naming it, or (for a reroute) the built-in agent runs.

## The Agents list (Settings)

**Save Claude usage** (off by default) asks Claude to delegate substantial implementation, exploration,
reviews and research to the models added to the Agent tool's model parameter first, choosing by description,
even when a description says to prefer built-in Claude subagents. Claude works itself or uses built-in agents
only when none fits. The catalog stores this as `saveClaude`; older catalogs decode it as false.

One global list. Each entry:

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| name | The value Claude passes as `model`. A slug; `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `fable`, `inherit`, `best`, `opusplan` and anything starting with `claude-` are reserved, because the native model wins. |
| description | The role Claude reads ("Second opinion on tricky bugs"). Also sent to the backend as instructions. |
| provider | Claude account pool, Codex, Z.ai, OpenRouter (Antigravity: see below). |
| model | Picked from the provider's live list (Codex `model/list`, OpenRouter `/api/v1/models` filtered to tool use, Z.ai fixed list). |
| effort | Preset (fixed level), or the call's `effort`, which wins over the preset (levels the model lacks are an error, not a silent clamp). |
| enabled | Off removes it from the list; a call already in flight or a stale one gets a clear "not available" error. |

lastdrop writes the list as a revisioned catalog in Application Support. Credentials never go in it.
`lastdrop --agent-catalog` prints the enabled agents (reserved names left out) and `agentModels: true`, which
tells the plugin the app speaks this design.

## Changing the list from an agent

`lastdrop --agents` changes the list without Settings: `list`, `models <provider>`, `set` (JSON on stdin, added or
replaced by name), `remove <name>` and `saving on|off`, with `--help` for the details. It prints JSON, or a reason on
stderr with exit code 1. `set` makes Settings' checks and also refuses a model or effort the provider's live list
doesn't have. A provider whose list fails leaves a warning, and its ids are taken as they are, as Settings lets you
type them. Sign-ins and API keys stay in Settings.

Every writer goes through `AgentCatalog.update`, which reads the file and saves it under a lock, so the app and the
command can't lose each other's edits. The command also sends a distributed notification, so an open Settings page
reloads.

Claude finds the command through one line that ends the frozen listing: "Only if the user asks to change these, run
<path> --agents --help". It costs about 25 tokens once per session, and the instructions are read only when needed.
Nothing enforces the "only if": the normal Bash permission prompt is what stops an unrequested change. It sits in the
frozen text, so it can't change a replayed message, and a listing frozen before it existed keeps its bytes. Notes
leave it out, so a session that started with no added agents doesn't get it until its listing is rebuilt.

## How it reaches Claude Code

**The listing.** A `prompt.attachment` hook rewrites the `agent_listing_delta` row for the main loop only,
when the engine wrote it and the text starts with `Available agent types`. Subagents' own copies, removal-only
deltas and every other attachment are left alone.

**Freezing.** Claude Code re-resolves replayed messages on resume, so a list that followed the catalog would
change old messages and miss the prompt cache. The appended text is stored per session on first rewrite and
reused for every later `Available agent types` text of that session. Compaction of the main loop clears it,
so the fresh listing is current; so does `/clear`. Old sessions' entries are pruned (about the latest 100).

**Notes.** The plugin syncs the catalog before each prompt. When the list differs from what the session was
last told, `prompt.submit` attaches a short context note ("The models the user added to the Agent tool's model
parameter changed. It now accepts: …", or "…were removed.") and remembers it. The first prompt of a session
has nothing frozen yet, so no note. If a later prompt finds no frozen listing while agents exist, Claude Code's
listing format probably changed: the plugin sends the whole list through the same note and shows its status
once.

**Routing (`tool.call`).** `fork` goes first, as before. Then, for a `model` that isn't `sonnet`, `opus`,
`haiku` or `fable`:

- unknown after a catalog resync → denied, naming what is available ("Model x isn't available. Use sonnet, opus,
  haiku, fable, or: sol, argon.");
- a known agent called with `agentId`, `name`, remote isolation or a `subagent_type` other than
  `general-purpose`, `claude`, `Explore` or `Plan` → denied with a reason;
- otherwise `lastdrop --agent-route` is asked with `agent: <name>` (and `role: Explore | Plan` for those types,
  no `model`). Room is checked as today; no room → denied.

The plugin then passes the call to the engine without `model` and without worktree isolation, so the engine
validates it and creates its own task. The call's arguments in the transcript are not changed: the model's
`model: "sol"` stays. `agent.spawn` claims the task, and `turn.step` runs `lastdrop --agent-run` and serves the
report. Native models, `SendMessage` to older routes and every other call behave as before. A
`subagent_type: "lastdrop:x"` from before the update is denied with `model: "x"` as the replacement; runs
started under the old names can still be continued.

**The `subagent_type` form.** Models often try the name as the agent type first (`subagent_type: "sol"`). When
the name is in the catalog, the plugin takes it as the added model and runs the call as `general-purpose`. If the
call also has a different `model`, it is denied naming both choices. A custom agent type with the same name wins:
the plugin only accepts the form when it has seen the native listing, and otherwise says to use `model: "sol"`.

**Report header.** A successful added-agent run starts with `Ran on <model>.`, plus ` Worktree: <path> (branch
<branch>).` when it had one, and on a following line `Declined (needed approval): a; b` when the provider asked
for approvals lastdrop declined. A Claude reroute with a worktree gets just the worktree line.

Usage saving adds one named block through `prompt.context`, leaving the shared system prompt intact.
Claude renders context before prompt-submit hooks, so the context hook reads the catalog itself and
invalidates that cached answer for the next prompt.

Claude Code sends a block with an unrouted name in one copy, made when the conversation holds none, and a
later answer doesn't add to, change or take back a copy that stands. In a running conversation:

- Switched on: the next prompt carries the block, added at the end of the conversation.
- Switched off, or the prompt text edited: the copy already sent stays, and the model keeps reading it until
  compaction or `/clear`. New conversations and compacted ones use the current setting.

No case changes what was already sent, so the switch keeps the prompt cache. A request capture (2026-10-30,
Claude Code 2.1.311, local mock API) found `tools` and `system` unchanged by the switch, and each request's
cached prefix byte-identical in the next through on, off and text edits. The instruction stayed in the request
after switching off and left only with compaction. The earlier `/context` check logged the hook's answer, not
what the model receives.
See the [mod API declarations](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/mods/types/claude-code.d.ts),
`prompt.context`, `prompt.attachment` and `tool.call`.

Evidence (Claude Code 2.1.311, no bypass flags): the requests are byte-identical in `tools` and `system` with and
without the plugin, and only the listing text differs. A model passed outside the enum reaches `tool.call`
before validation, and rewriting through `next` keeps the model's own `model: "sol"` in the transcript. With the
"models the user added" wording, Sonnet used `sol` for reviews 10/10 and `argon` for opinions 10/10, and Opus 5/5
each, all on the first try with `model`, and no added model for a search (Sonnet 0/10, Opus 0/5). These are small
samples through `claude -p`. See [research H](research/H-agent-models.md) for the byte checks and live runs.

## Routing rules

- An added agent always runs on its provider and its model: never the built-in agent, never another provider,
  never another model. A Claude-provider agent may move among the accounts in the pool (one at its limit, or
  without the model, passes it on); the provider and model stay the same. The exclusions that apply today (forks, teammates, nested calls…) become errors for added agents.
- Out of room, signed out, model not on the plan → an error that says which and when it resets.
- The run keeps the provider, model, effort and session id it started with; `SendMessage` continues there even
  if the entry was edited since. A read-only role is kept too.
- A plain Claude call (a native model, or none) goes through a chain: the other Claude accounts first, the one
  with the most room; then the built-in agent itself, exactly as if lastdrop hadn't
  touched the call. When no other account takes it before any work was done (every attempt was refused for a
  limit or a plan without the model), the runner says `native` and the plugin lets the built-in agent run. The
  model is never swapped on the way. A call with worktree isolation, whose built-in shell has none, and a run
  already underway (its session moves on to the next account, the session's own last) stay with the runner.
- Every account is tried: one that refuses the model (a plan without it) is skipped for that run only, with nothing
  remembered between runs, so a plan or credit change is noticed at once.

## Fallbacks

An agent has one or more models by priority, each with its own provider, model and optional effort. The catalog
keeps the first as the agent's own and the rest as `fallbacks` (Settings → Agents, **Models**, one list by priority, at least one entry: "Tried in order. The next one runs only if the one above can't start, never once
work has begun."). The list is empty by default, so an agent without one reads and behaves as before, and the
stored catalog doesn't even carry the key.

The list shows the chain, so Claude knows what it is choosing: `sol: Reviews… (Codex · gpt-6.1-sol · high, then
Antigravity · gemini-4-argon)`.

A fallback is tried only when an attempt fails before any work happened, and for a reason about availability: a
usage limit, a sign-in or key, a provider that isn't installed, a model the account doesn't have, or an effort the
provider doesn't take (an error, never a silent clamp). Never after a tool ran, and never for another error: an
empty report, a bug, or a stop (`TaskStop` ends the whole chain at once). The call's `effort` wins over each
attempt's own. The read-only role and worktree isolation apply to every attempt, and a worktree a failed attempt
made is removed before the next starts.

For the plugin, each switch is a `moved` line (with the next `provider` and `model`), followed by a new `started`
line with the same `agentId` and the attempt's own `account`, `model` and `provider`, which updates the same row.
The `result` line carries `provider` (what ran) and `unavailable`, the models tried and skipped, when there are
any, and the report starts `Ran on gemini-4-argon-high (gpt-6.1-sol unavailable).` If every attempt fails the
error lists each one and why. Claude never stands in, unless the user put a Claude entry in the list.

The same model at another effort is its own attempt (`sol` at `xhigh`, then `sol` at `high`). A catalog saved by an
older version of the app drops fallbacks, which it doesn't know.

A follow-up (`SendMessage`) continues on the attempt that ran, from the entry saved for it, with no chain.

## Worktrees

With `isolation: "worktree"`, Codex and Antigravity runs get `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/agent-<id>` on the branch
`worktree-agent-<id>`, as Claude Code names its own, in the same subfolder the call was made from. A run that
changed nothing (clean tree, no commits) has its worktree and branch removed, as Claude Code does, and reports
none; one that changed something keeps it, and the report's `Worktree:` line names its top and branch.
`SendMessage` continues in it. Claude-runner providers use Claude Code's own `--worktree`. As for native
worktrees, git sees `.claude/worktrees/` as untracked unless the repository ignores it.

## Roles

`Explore` and `Plan` run read-only on an added agent, however the permission mode is set, and get a brief in
their instructions (search and report; return a step-by-step plan). Codex gets the read-only sandbox,
Antigravity plan mode, and the Claude-runner providers (Claude accounts, Z.ai, OpenRouter)
`--disallowedTools Edit,Write,NotebookEdit`.

## Limits

- Main session only: subagents don't get the list and can't call added agents.
- Added agents run only as `general-purpose`, `claude`, `Explore` or `Plan`.
- On Claude-runner providers a read-only role still allows `Bash`, which can write. Native Explore has the same
  gap there; its restriction is by instruction.
- The Agent tool's schema still shows four values for `model`; Claude follows the listing, and the plugin
  accepts the rest before validation.
- Provider permission requests are declined and reported (`Declined (needed approval)`), not asked. Argon
  (Antigravity) can't run shell commands headless: denied commands are reported, and it continues without
  them (its turn ends at the denial, so lastdrop continues the conversation once with a short prompt).
  `agy` does accept per-session allow rules (`--settings '{"permissions":{"allow":["command(<exact command>)"]}}'`),
  which lastdrop doesn't turn on by itself.
- In auto mode, reports from routed agents can carry Claude Code's notice that its safety classifier was
  unavailable. Likely cause, not confirmed: the handoff classifier can't review a synthetic transcript.
  lastdrop leaves this as it is rather than bypass a safety check.
- During an update, an older runner that is still running can strip `role` and the worktree fields from the
  ledger once, so a follow-up to a read-only agent started before the update may lose its read-only role. A brief,
  transient limit.
- A session started before the update gets the list at its next resume, with one prompt-cache miss.

## Backends

Two runners cover four providers.

**1. Claude Code runner (exists).** Claude accounts as today, plus any Anthropic-compatible endpoint:
- Z.ai: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<Coding Plan API key>`,
  GLM model ids for every model role. Effort maps to GLM low/high/max. Needs a Coding Plan **API key**: the
  web session lastdrop keeps can't do inference. Ask for the key in Settings first; creating it through the
  console's private API comes later, if ever.
- OpenRouter: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api`, a regular (not management) key, model pinned to an
  OpenRouter id. Non-Claude models through Claude Code are unproven: mark each model "tested" only after a
  tracer run passes.
- Each provider gets its own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (`~/.claude-accounts/zai`, …) with its own settings (no
  symlinked settings: they'd carry the user's env), and the runner scrubs every inherited `ANTHROPIC_*`
  variable before setting the provider's. Warm processes are keyed by provider and profile too: a live
  process can't change endpoint.
- New error classes: Z.ai business codes 1308/1310/1316–1321 (window exhausted) vs 1302/1305 (throttling);
  OpenRouter 402 (credit). Today's runner treats neither correctly.
- Free later: Kimi, DeepSeek, MiniMax use the same path.

**2. Codex runner (new).** `codex app-server --listen stdio://`, not `codex exec` (research B §1): it streams
items, lists models with their efforts, resumes and interrupts threads, and reports rate limits and typed
errors (`usageLimitExceeded`, …). Borrow from the bridge fork: JSON-RPC transport, lifecycle races, thread
persistence, wait logic (B §2, with the bugs to leave behind). Mapping:
- Items → transcript: commands → `Bash: …`, file changes, MCP calls, web search as tool rows; agent messages
  as text; the reasoning summary and plan as text. Final answer = the turn's final-phase message.
- Permission modes → sandbox + approval (default and auto → workspace-write + auto review, as a Claude
  agent's default becomes auto; acceptEdits → workspace-write; plan → read-only; bypass → full access).
  Antigravity likewise: default, acceptEdits and auto → accept-edits; plan → plan. Approval requests nobody can answer are declined,
  never left hanging.
- The user's MCP servers are translated from `~/.claude.json` into per-thread config overrides, except
  servers Codex already configures itself (`config/read`), which keep Codex's entry (LCU needs its Codex adapter); the role
  goes in `developerInstructions`; CLAUDE.md content is passed explicitly (Codex only reads AGENTS.md).
- Open in Terminal: `cd <cwd> && CODEX_HOME=<home> codex resume <threadId>` (stop the runner's copy first).
- Worktree isolation: lastdrop creates the worktree before `thread/start`, named as Claude Code names its own (see Worktrees).

**3. Antigravity: through the official `agy` CLI as a child process (the user decided to go ahead; no OAuth token reuse).** `agy -p --output-format stream-json` would work technically (research D §4),
but Google's current FAQ calls wrapping `agy` in third-party coding agents unsupported on consumer plans,
its terms ban reusing the Antigravity OAuth, and it has banned accounts for this before. A Google forum
moderator said the opposite; that conflict is still open. Revisit once Google answers it in writing. Gemini
CLI no longer runs on consumer subscriptions. Separately: lastdrop's usage reading already uses Antigravity's
OAuth client and User-Agent, which those same terms cover. Worth reviewing.

## Order of work

1. Catalog + Settings list + listing and routing hooks, using the Claude account pool as the only
   provider. Proves registration, live edits, disable and errors with no new backend.
2. Z.ai and OpenRouter on the Claude Code runner (config dirs, env scrub, warm-pool keys, error classes).
3. Codex runner.
4. Antigravity if and when Google's policy allows it.

Each backend ships after a tracer run passes: Read/Bash/Edit, warm start, continue, stop, transcript, Open in
Terminal, and a quota-exhausted error.
